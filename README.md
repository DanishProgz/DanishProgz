# Hi, I'm Danish

I am an Embedded Systems Engineer with over 4 years of experience in firmware development and IoT solutions.  
My main focus is on Embedded C programming for STM32, ESP32, and nRF52, often using FreeRTOS for reliable real-time systems.  

I enjoy building systems that combine hardware and software, from writing custom drivers to optimizing devices for low power and connecting them to the cloud.
